# CPP-STL-Practice
Personal Workspace for C++ STL

## Components
STL has four components.
* Algorithms
* Containers
* Functors
* Iterators

### Algorithms
The header algorithm defines many common algorithms. Example: binary_search()
### Containers
Storages for objects and data. Example: set, list, vector, ...
### Functors
Classes that overload function call operator. It overloads operator().
### Iterators
Process on a sequence of values.
